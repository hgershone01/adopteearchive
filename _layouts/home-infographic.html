    <h2>Environmental justice is adoptee justice.</h2>
    <p>First and foremost a resource for adoptees, Adoptee Literary and Art Archive directly addresses the gap in scholarly and public discourse between environmental justice and adoptee justice, aiming to uplift and increase the visibility of adoptee voices and environmentalism. This digital humanities project was designed to be a long-term project using open-source tools and frameworks which are accessible to future activists and scholars. This WordPress site is temporary; the actual digital archive is currently in development, and will be published on CollectionBuilder</p>

    <p>All self-identifying transracial adoptees (those who identify as a different race than their adoptive parent(s)), of 18 years of age or older, are invited to contribute literature or artwork exploring their relationship with the environment. The archive also invites intergenerational adoptees to contribute, or those who may have immediate family members who were adopted transracially (such as a parent).</p>
    
    <p>In short, Adoptee Literary and Art Archive was created in the legacy of transracial adoptee activism that proclaims, ‘we are not invisible and we are not silent’ in the movement for just environmental futures.</p>
