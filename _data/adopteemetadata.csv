Many transracial/transnational adoptees write about the ocean in their poetry, short memoirs, or creative fiction. I don’t remember seeing the ocean when I left China for the first time; I was too young (and too small to see out the window). But when I think about home, the first thing that comes to mind is the deep, clear lakes in Minnesota. I remember how I feel weightless in the water and completely calm. I remember feeling surrounded by the sun. To me, this home.   ","Hannah Gershone is a Chinese transracial adoptee from Minnesota. She ‘came out of the fog’ on adoption during her early twenties and has been committed to adoptee and environmental justice ever since. Currently an Environmental Studies master’s student at the University of Oregon, her current research examines transracial/transnational adoptee environmentalism in the age of uncertain climate futurities. When she is not reading about the adoption industrial complex, you can find her cooking, walking in the sun, and spending time with her cat. "
