# About the Archive

## This project began out of disappointment.

Why are spaces outside the adoptee community silent on environmental injustices surrounding adoption? 

In the discourse surrounding uncertain toxic futurities, reproductive anxieties, and climate disasters, adoptees of color (and their birth families) are typically erased in narratives of humanitarianism and environmentalism.

*Adoptee Literary and Art Archive* argues that **environmental justice is adoptee justice.**

**We seek to uplift the voices and environmentalisms of transracial adoptees who identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, with the knowledge that they are essential for just futures.**

**We aim to begin a conversation surrounding the intersections of transracial adoption, art, and environment.**

First and foremost a resource for adoptees, *Adoptee Literary and Art Archive* directly addresses the gap in scholarly and public discourse between environmental justice and adoptee justice, aiming to uplift and increase the visibility of adoptee voices and environmentalism. 

All self-identifying transracial adoptees (those who identify as a different race than their adoptive parent(s)), of 18 years of age or older, are invited to contribute literature or artwork exploring their relationship with the environment. The archive also invites intergenerational adoptees to contribute, or those who may have immediate family members who were adopted transracially (such as a parent).

*Adoptee Literary and Art Archive* was created by **Hannah L. Gershone** as her terminal master's project in 2022 in the University of Oregon's Environmental Studies Department. She was advised, mentored, and in collaboration with her committee: **Dr. Sarah Wald (chair)**, **Kate Thornhill**, and **Dr. Mattie Burkert**. Designed to be a long-term project, this site was generated using [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/about.html), which was developed by librarians at the University of Idaho, as an open-source framework for creating free and simple digital collections projects. 

*Adoptee Literary and Art Archive* is still in progress today and accepts new submissions during the Spring and Fall of each year.

In short, *Adoptee Literary and Art Archive* was created in the legacy of transracial adoptee activism that proclaims, ‘we are not invisible and we are not silent’ in the movement for just environmental futures.
