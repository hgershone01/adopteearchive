# Formatting and Editing Resources

A few resources for contributors to help get started in formatting and editing. If you have any free and easy-to-use formatting/editing programs you’d like to recommend, please feel free to email [adopteearchive@gmail.com.](mailto:adopteearchive@gmail.com)

## Image Formatting and Optimization

### [<u>GIMP</u>]((https://www.gimp.org/about/)) 

  - Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Recommended by CollectionBuilder for image editing. Free and open-source editing software

### [<u>Squoosh</u>]((https://squoosh.app/)) 

  - Recommended by CollectionBuilder for image optimization. Free to use, and you can change the file size and resolution. For photographs with a resolution over 200 dpi, the online version may be slower to load for editing purposes.

  - Mac’s proprietary image viewer and editor. If you open an image using Preview, you can view the DPI (resolution) by:
  1. Navigating to the toolbar

- Adjust the size and resolution of your image by selecting 'Tools' and then 'Adjust Size' from the drop-down menu
