# Visual Representations (Images)

We do not have the means to physically house artwork. In this context, 'visual representations' refer to images of your work. Visual representations include, but are not limited to: sculptures, photography, textiles, drawings, glasswork, jewelry, and prints. For example, if you made a painting, you would take a photograph of it and submit the photo to the archive.

[A few resources for visual representation (image) editing can be found on the site.]()

### Visual Representation (Image) Formatting Guidelines

- JPG

- Maximum number of images for the same work: 3 (all images must meet guidelines)

- Resolution: 72-200 dpi (100 recommended)

  - Note: You may submit a higher-resolution image that will be kept on file until we have the capacity to publish them in the archive. For now, larger images will be downsized when published on the site.
