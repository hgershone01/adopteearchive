## Project Description 

*Adoptee Literary and Art Archive* is Hannah Gershone’s terminal Environmental Studies master’s thesis. An interdisciplinary, digital literary and art archive, it seeks to center transracial adoptee voices, experiences, and activisms surrounding transracial adoption and the environment, particularly within the context of climate change. The archive is also meant to serve as a site of primary resources, and help bridge the scholarly gap, for those interested in
discussing transracial adoption and environment within the same breath.
